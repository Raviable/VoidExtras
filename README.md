The Void's Extras is a server plugin for the webfishing dedicated server software known as Cove, it offers a few easy to set up text display commands (!Rules and !Discord) as well as a few fun commands as of now.

<h1>Installation</h1>

after downloading both VoidExtras.dll and voidsettings.json, put VoidExtras into the plugins directory as-per-usual but place voidsettings.json into the same directory as your cove executable file (the same place that server.cfg and bans.txt are also present).
